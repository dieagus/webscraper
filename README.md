Project I created to experiment with web scaping, takes shoes information from goat.com.
The code uses the Beautiful Soup 4 (BS4) library to extract data from the website. Code also uses selenium to simulate the scrolling, as goat.com is an infinite scrollng website.

webscraper.py is the code for the web scraper

shoes is the text file for each of the shoe entries, each entry is formatted as [shoe name, price, image source]
